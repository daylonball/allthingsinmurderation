            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                There are multiple phases and acts in the game. They are outlined below. <br>
                You may have to do multiple playthroughs to find the killer based on previous knowledge of outcomes!<br> <br>
            <h4>Intro/Tutorial: </h4> 
                <li>You cannot explore the Chalet until you enter the Dining Hall (to the right of the stairs) and begin the first act.</li> <br>
            
            <h4> Act 1: Dining Phase 1,2 & 3: </h4> <br>
                <li> After entering the Dining Hall you enter the first act which is comprised of 3 Dinner phases </li>
                <li> You can progress these dinner phases by speaking to Willem </li>
                <li> Talking to people, dialogue choices, and picking up items will determine what story line branch you get so choose wisely! </li>
                <li> After ending the 3rd phase of the Dinner party (Act 1) a murder will occured! </li>
                <br>
            <h4> Act 2: Investigation: </h4> <br>
                <li>You will now have complete access to the lodge and must investigate the Chalet </li>
                <li>You can investigate the murder by talking to NPCs to gain insight on motive and evidence on other NPCs that may have commited the crime of murder! </li>
                <li>Sometimes there are more dialogue choices than displayed, thus use the arrow keys to cycle through the multiple dialogue choices</li>
                <li>You will also need to collect evidence in the form of pickup-able items scattered around the Chalet</li>
                <li>You get 5 permanent pickups in your inventory and these items must be able to convince the group of your accusation! </li>
                <li>Once you have 5 items you can progress to the accusation act to try and accuse one of the NPCs of murder!</li>
            
            <h4> Act 3: Accusation: </h4> <br>
                <li>You now must use the evidence you collected and the motives you learned to accuse one of the NPCs! (You can accuse the dead NPC as well in some cases)</li>
                <li>Talk to Willem to accuse a murderer! (In the event of Willem's death, speak to his daughter)</li>
                <li>Use the arrow keys to cycle through the multiple choices (not all are shown on the screen at one time)</li>
                <li>Provide the evidence you feel is the most compelling when asked to provide it (You must convince everyone) </li>
                <li>Depending on your choices you may catch the murderer and win! Give the wrong evidence and motives you will lose!</li>
            </ul>
